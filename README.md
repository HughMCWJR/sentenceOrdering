## Install

I did not keep track of what needed to be installed for this to function, I can go back and do this later.

## Models

### GPT

For this model to work, I simply added a text file containing my OpenAI key named gptKey.txt. If that is too insecure, I can go back and make this use environmental variables.

### BART, LLama

This should work out of the box after making the requisite installs.

### Flan

This model does not currently work because of its retrictive token limits and because it is trained for short answers.
